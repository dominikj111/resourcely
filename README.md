Resourcely is a Rust library that provides a convenient way to manage and access resources from both local and remote sources. It offers a unified interface for reading and writing structured data with built-in caching and staleness control.

## Features

- **Unified Resource Access**: Consistent API for both local and remote resources
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for JSON and YAML <span style="color:gray">_(TOML and plain text in development)_</span>
- **Caching**: Configurable caching with time-based expiration
- **Staleness Control**: Fine-grained control over when to use cached data
- **Thread-Safe**: Designed for concurrent access using `Arc<T>` for zero-cost sharing across threads

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
resourcely = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use resourcely::{Local, Remote, ResourceFileType};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use std::path::PathBuf;

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, Default, Clone)]
struct Config {
    api_key: String,
    timeout: u32,
}

// Local file resource
let local = Local::new(
    "config.json".to_string(),
    ResourceFileType::Json,
    PathBuf::from("./config"),
    None, // No cache timeout
);

// Remote resource
let remote = Remote::new(
    "data.json".to_string(),
    ResourceFileType::Json,
    "https://api.example.com/data".to_string(),
    PathBuf::from("/tmp/resourcely/cache"),
    Some(std::time::Duration::from_secs(300)), // 5 minute cache
);
```

## Usage

### Reading Data

```rust
use resourcely::{DataResult, ResourceReader};

// Get data or return error
match local.get_data_or_error(false).await {
    Ok(DataResult::Fresh(data)) => println!("Fresh data: {:?}", data),
    Ok(DataResult::Stale(data)) => println!("Stale data: {:?}", data),
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {}", e),
}

// Get data or default
let data = remote.get_data_or_default(false).await;
println!("Data: {:?}", data);

// Get data or none
if let Some(data) = local.get_data_or_none(true).await {
    println!("Got data: {:?}", data);
}
```

### Marking Data as Stale

```rust
// Force refresh on next read
local.mark_as_stale()?;

// Check if data is marked as stale
if local.is_marked_stale()? {
    println!("Data is marked as stale");
}

// Check if data is fresh (considering cache timeouts and stale marker)
if local.is_fresh()? {
    println!("Data is fresh");
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Parsing

The library provides support for JSON and YAML formats out of the box. TOML and plain text formats are defined in the `ResourceFileType` enum but not yet implemented. You can extend functionality by implementing the `ResourceReader` trait for your custom types.

### Resource State Management

The `ResourceReader` trait provides several methods for managing resource state:

```rust
// Check if data is fresh (not stale and within cache timeout)
let is_fresh = resource.is_fresh()?;

// Check if data is marked as stale
let is_stale = resource.is_marked_stale()?;

// Mark data as stale to force refresh
resource.mark_as_stale()?;
```

### Builder Pattern (Incomplete)

A builder pattern is partially implemented but currently incomplete:

```rust
// Note: Builder implementation is currently incomplete
// and references undefined traits (LocalResource, RemoteResource)
// Use the direct state_manager API for now
```

### Error Handling

All operations return `Result` types with descriptive error messages for better error handling.

## Design Decisions

### Thread-Safe Architecture

Resourcely uses `Arc<T>` to enable zero-cost sharing of data across multiple threads. This means multiple readers can access the same cached data simultaneously without cloning, making it ideal for web servers, concurrent applications, and multi-threaded data processing.

### Dual-Layer Result Pattern

The library returns `Result<DataResult<Arc<T>>, ResourceError>` which cleanly separates:

- **Operational errors** (`ResourceError`): File not found, network failures, parsing errors
- **Cache semantics** (`DataResult`): Whether data is fresh or stale, enabling intelligent cache management

This pattern allows you to handle errors appropriately while still making informed decisions about data freshness.

### Generic Type Requirements

The trait bounds `T: Send + Sync + DeserializeOwned + Serialize + Default` ensure:

- **Send + Sync**: Thread safety for concurrent access across multiple threads
- **DeserializeOwned + Serialize**: Support for multiple data formats (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- **Default**: Graceful fallback when data is unavailable or parsing fails

These constraints represent the minimal requirements for a thread-safe, generic resource management system.

## Contributing

**Note**: This library is currently in pre-release development. The first public release is planned once local CRUD operations are implemented, as this represents a complete MVP for practical use cases.

The library follows a philosophy of minimalism with maximum flexibility. We maintain a clean development roadmap and can accommodate new requirements as they arise, but all contributions must align with the library's core principles.
